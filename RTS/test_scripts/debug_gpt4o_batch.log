2028 DNC POTUS candidate since 6/1/18:
1) End genocide globally 
2) Pardon 100k protestors 
3) Nuremberg type trials
4) Zero donations over $28
5) Crush fascism
My professional focus has been intensely directed towards significant cases such as Camp L, Talcum, Roundup, and the Maui fire. The latter, a personal tragedy, where I lost friends, has only strengthened my resolve. Relocating to Arizona has marked a new chapter in my mission to support and empower those affected by such devastating events.

In addition to my advocacy in these areas, I also specialize in the provision of quality leads and transfers in the insurance and nursing sectors. My goal is to facilitate meaningful connections that aid recovery and bring about positive change.

Hey there, I'm Shaun! I love being the bridge between engineers and everyone else and thrive in environments where soft skills are just as important as technical skills. I'm am an extreme power-user of products and I love to nerd out with APIs, Computer Vision, Salesforce, and all sorts of data.

Getting to use both my soft skills and technical skills on a regular basis is important to me. I genuinely enjoy managing and building teams and working with people from all backgrounds and experiences. Leveraging my technical experiences to improve processes and empower others is what gets me up in the morning.

I graduated from Iowa State University in 2016, where I received my B.S. in Software Engineering. During my academic career, I was able to do a full-time internship at 6 different amazing companies including Twilio, Microsoft, Amazon, Boeing, the MathWorks, and Union Pacific. During these internships, I gained great insight into what software engineering is all about and was able to pick up best practices from a wide variety of work environments. 

LET'S CONNECT
Feel free to send me an email any time, shauntvanweelden [AT] gmail [DOT] com
Scaled from $1M to $100M in annual revenue run rate in my first 11 months working with the team.

I've had fun helping shape Mercor's strategy, go-to-market, compliance, and, most recently, Talent Success efforts, something near and dear to my heart.

My strategy is shaped by empathy, transparency, and vulnerability to our co-workers, our clients, and our talent.

I'm a PhD and polyglot with 25+ years of industry, startup, and academic experience in software and systems engineering. I am also a frequent public speaker and illustrator whose visual guides and sketchnotes have been used in technical documentation, marketing campaigns, conferences and curricula, to make complex concepts more accessible to broad audiences and visual learners.

My early career was research-driven with a focus on distributed systems, reliability engineering and ubiquitous computing. I co-authored 30+ publications and 10+ patents in areas like context-aware frameworks, mobile computing and multi-screen advertising. I managed research teams and led multi-disciplinary projects and oversaw signature university collaborations with faculty at University of Michigan, Georgia Tech, UIUC, UIC, Northwestern and CMU - in areas ranging from distributed file systems, virtualization tooling, pervasive computing, and context-aware systems.

As a remote worker, I discovered the power of local and virtual communities as a way of staying connected to the rapid pace of technology innovation and its impact on real-world economies. It led me to a passion for community building, consulting, and entrepreneurship. I have over a decade of experience building successful tech communities in the Greater New York area, helping skill thousands of developers by organizing meetups and developer conferences, and delivering online courses and workshops. 

I pivoted to consulting to support local businesses and startups, expanding my research roots with new software development and startup engineering roles and responsibilities. I helped early-stage startups define strategy, build prototypes and secure funding and worked with local engineering colleges (as adjunct faculty and industry advisor) to add mobile & cloud skills to their curricula. I also established community programs and workshops to help members of under-represented communities gain soft skills in public speaking, visual storytelling, and proposal writing.

My passion for education and community led to my current role in AI & Advocacy at Microsoft. I am "developer 0" for our products, providing early feedback to improve developer experience. I build and lead core efforts around content and sample creation that transform product awareness into productive adoption. I'm a visual storyteller whose illustrated guides have been featured in leadership posts, technical documentation and curriculum. And I'm a creative problem solver and innovator interested in reimagining education and productivity in the era of AI.

Profile Data:
Hi all, I'm a full-stack data scientist who gets the entire data science journey—from gathering data to deploying solutions. I dive into data mining, analysis, machine learning, and data engineering, and I'm just as comfortable building APIs, managing data pipelines, and working with databases as I am designing user interfaces and deploying models. Beyond the tech, I value clear communication and collaboration across teams, always keeping an eye on how technical solutions drive real business results.
