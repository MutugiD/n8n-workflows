I am also a frequent public speaker and illustrator whose visual guides and sketchnotes have been used in technical documentation, marketing campaigns, conferences and curricula, to make complex concepts more accessible to broad audiences and visual learners.\n\nMy early career was research-driven with a focus on distributed systems, reliability engineering and ubiquitous computing. I co-authored 30+ publications and 10+ patents in areas like context-aware frameworks, mobile computing and multi-screen advertising. I managed research teams and led multi-disciplinary projects and oversaw signature university collaborations with faculty at University of Michigan, Georgia Tech, UIUC, UIC, Northwestern and CMU - in areas ranging from distributed file systems, virtualization tooling, pervasive computing, and context-aware systems.\n\nAs a remote worker, I discovered the power of local and virtual communities as a way of staying connected to the rapid pace of technology innovation and its impact on real-world economies. It led me to a passion for community building, consulting, and entrepreneurship. I have over a decade of experience building successful tech communities in the Greater New York area, helping skill thousands of developers by organizing meetups and developer conferences, and delivering online courses and workshops. \n\nI pivoted to consulting to support local businesses and startups, expanding my research roots with new software development and startup engineering roles and responsibilities. I helped early-stage startups define strategy, build prototypes and secure funding and worked with local engineering colleges (as adjunct faculty and industry advisor) to add mobile & cloud skills to their curricula. I also established community programs and workshops to help members of under-represented communities gain soft skills in public speaking, visual storytelling, and proposal writing.\n\nMy passion for education and community led to my current role in AI & Advocacy at Microsoft. I am \"developer 0\" for our products, providing early feedback to improve developer experience. I build and lead core efforts around content and sample creation that transform product awareness into productive adoption. I'm a visual storyteller whose illustrated guides have been featured in leadership posts, technical documentation and curriculum. And I'm a creative problem solver and innovator interested in reimagining education and productivity in the era of AI.",
